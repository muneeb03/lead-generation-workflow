## üîë API Keys

Some data sources require API keys for full functionality:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
HUNTER_IO_API_KEY=your_hunter_io_key
CLEARBIT_API_KEY=your_clearbit_key
APOLLO_IO_API_KEY=your_apollo_io_key
ZOOMINFO_API_KEY=your_zoominfo_key
```

2. Load environment variables:
```bash
source .env  # On Windows, use: set -a; . .env; set +a
```

## üîÑ Proxy Support

For improved reliability and to avoid rate limiting:

1. Create a `proxies.txt` file with one proxy per line:
```
http://user:pass@proxy1.example.com:8080
http://user:pass@proxy2.example.com:8080
```

2. Use the `--proxy` flag or set the `PROXY_LIST` environment variable.

## üìä Example Output

The tool creates Excel files with multiple sheets:

1. **All Leads** - Combined data from all sources
2. One sheet per source (Google Maps, Yelp, etc.)

Each lead typically includes:
- Name/Organization
- Contact information (email, phone)
- Address
- Website
- Industry-specific details
- Source metadata

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Considerations

**Important**: Web scraping may violate terms of service for some websites. This tool is for educational purposes only. Always:

1. Review and respect each website's robots.txt file
2. Implement appropriate rate limiting
3. Consider using official APIs when available
4. Ensure compliance with local laws regarding data collection and privacy

## üîç Customization

### Adding New Sources

1. Create a new method in the `LeadGenerationAgent` class:
```python
def search_new_source(self, industry, location, lead_count=20):
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

2. Add the source to the appropriate category in `self.sources`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Selenium errors**: Ensure ChromeDriver is compatible with your Chrome version
2. **Rate limiting**: Increase the delay between requests with `--delay`
3. **IP blocking**: Use the proxy rotation feature with `--proxy`
4. **Missing data**: Some fields may be unavailable from certain sources
